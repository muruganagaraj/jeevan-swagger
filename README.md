RestGen
=======
RestGen is a set of .NET client code generators for RESTful services.

Currently RestGen can understand Swagger endpoints and we are planning to add support for ASP.NET Web API soon.

In this initial version, we're adding generators for Typescript and JavaScript, with support for jQuery and AngularJS $http frameworks.

Future versions will add support for server-side languages like C# and Java, and will extend the client-side framework support.
